# -k-Nearest-Neighbors-classification-model

## Data Science Assignment: k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
This notebook applies k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for classification using
Python and pandas.
The following steps are being covered:
- Dataset exploeration
- Data preprocessing
- implement the k-NN model
- Evaluate its performance
- Research summary

*The notebook includes 2 experiments and eventually picks the best model.*
